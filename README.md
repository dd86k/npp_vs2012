Simple theme I made a very long time ago when I was still relying on Notepad++
for most of my editing. While VSCodium is my editor of choice, Notepad++
still remains for quick reading and editing purposes.

Recently updated to support D.

Typically installed in `%APPDATA%\Notepad++\themes`.

Tested for:
- assembly (x86)
- batch
- c
- c++
- css
- d
- html
- ini
